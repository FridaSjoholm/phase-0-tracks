I have 2 hours to learn jquery, to do this I am gonna start by trying to find a relatively short tutorial, pause the tutorial when neede to try it out. I'm also gonna look at some cheatsheets to get some kind of perspective of things to do. I'm gonna take three short breaks (after 30 minutes, 6, and 90) to get up and walk around. I'm also gonna write some of my discoveries down to make my own kind of cheatsheet.
