I have 2 hours to learn jquery, to do this I am gonna start by trying to find a relatively short tutorial, pause the tutorial when neede to try it out. I'm also gonna look at some cheatsheets to get some kind of perspective of things to do. I'm gonna take three short breaks (after 30 minutes, 6, and 90) to get up and walk around. I'm also gonna write some of my discoveries down to make my own kind of cheatsheet. 

I ended up looking at some great tutorials with exercise files, I went through the most basic videos first which took about an hour and the spent some time looking at different cheat sheets to explore different possibilities, and researched some things I felt was complicated. After 20 minutes of that research I went back to the tutorials and looked inte some areas I found really interesting. I also expanded the chunks of focus to be 45 minutes, which was better for me.
