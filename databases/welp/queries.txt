You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

sqlite> SELECT * FROM businesses, users, reviews WHERE reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id;
1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|1|Bradford|Pitt|1|5|Great place to get married! We will last forever!|1|1
1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|3|Angela|Jolie|2|2|ok place to get married! We are happy for now|1|3
2|Amir's Towing|4|Steven|Wonder|3|2|I never crash driving my car, so happy they were there for me in that unforeseeable moment|2|4
3|The Beagle Nightclub|6|Merryl|Streepman|4|4|Their 60's sundays are the best|3|6
4|Lotus Yoga|7|Denzel|George|5|5|Nothing relaxes me more than this place followed by chamomille tea|4|7


There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id;
Bradford|Pitt|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|5|Great place to get married! We will last forever!
Angela|Jolie|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|2|ok place to get married! We are happy for now
Steven|Wonder|Amir's Towing|2|I never crash driving my car, so happy they were there for me in that unforeseeable moment
Merryl|Streepman|The Beagle Nightclub|4|Their 60's sundays are the best
Denzel|George|Lotus Yoga|5|Nothing relaxes me more than this place followed by chamomille tea
