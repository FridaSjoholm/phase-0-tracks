# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	
*By using version controll you can clearly see what changes happened when and how. It is easy to keep track of how the projects have evolved and you can go back and see how it used yo be.* 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	
*A branch is a copy of the main project where you can build and try to evolve the code before applying the code to the main project. It is safer to do it this way and make sure you don't accidentally destroy a whole project, without knowing what happened.*

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?	
	
*A commit is when you create a save point after staging a change by telling git that the change should be part of the history of the current branch. To make sure that your teamm ates and you know what the change is about you need a short but clear commit message.*

* What is a merge conflict?
	
*A merge conflict is when there has been changes in the main repository in the same place as you've changed something in the branch and the versions does not fit together.*
