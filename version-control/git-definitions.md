# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control helps you keep track of files and changes as in a form of time line. It is useful because it allows multiple people to work at the same time, and merge their works later, without interfering each other while working in smaller branches.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
branch is like a making a copy version of a project, and by branching, you can work on different parts of the project without affecting the main project until you merge them. It allows you to work efficiently and keep things organized when working on a complicated coding projects.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
Commit is defined as a save point in git. It helps you keep tracks of any revisions, or any changes you made, whether adding a file, modifying, staginng or whatever, commits show you the history. A good message must be very specific in words, so you know exactly what you did.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when the branch you are trying to merge into do not match the commits with the branch you are currently in.
Hi, I'm just adding words for Release part 2 :)
