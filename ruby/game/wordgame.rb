#word guessing game
#
#The game with all its moves and actions is going to be a class. For each game We will need one word to work with, 
#which will be passed in with initialization. Within it we we will have these actions:
#
#- comparison, which compares the letter to the string, and if the letter exists within the string we will update 
#an array with underlines to show at what location in the word that letter is.
#- a counter, which makes sure the player doesntguess too many times (and calculates how many time it's allowed to do so), and if the guess has allready been made
#the counter method will also check if the game is finished (either by winning or guessing all letters)
