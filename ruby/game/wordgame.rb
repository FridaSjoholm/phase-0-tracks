#word guessing game
#
#The game with all its moves and actions is going to be a class. For each game We will need one word to work with, which will be passed in with initialization. Within it we we will have these actions:
#
#- comparison, which compares the letter to the string
#- a counter, which makes sure the player doesntguess too many times (and calculates how many time it's allowed to do so), and if the guess has allready been made-
#- Feedback on status, an array with as many underlines as in the word the use is trying to figure out, which gets updated to correct letters once guessed.
